## Impacts of upstream data modelling on downstream experience 
5 things to ask before pushing schema change to production

    1  Is a change management process embedded into your data engineering workflow? 
    2 What is the structure of your data organisation? 
    3 What impact up and downstream will the schema change have? 
    4 How will you communicate schema changes with the broader data team? 
    5 Are you measuring the impact of change management on your organisation? 
### What are views?
Virtual tables that do not store data physically; instead, they are defined by a query that pulls data from one or more underlying tables. 

### What are stored Procedures?
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again. So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

## CRUD Operations
* Create/Insert
* Read/Select
* Update
* Delete

## The importance of good data modelling
Data modelling is the process of creating a visual representation of a system or database, where data objects are defined and relationships between these objects are established. It involves the careful design of data structures and schema to ensure data integrity, efficiency in data handling, and alignment with business requirements.<br/>

### Key Terms
* Triggers - procedures that automatically execute in response to specific events on a particular table or view in a database
* Views - virtual tables based on SQL queries
* Stored Procedures - SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again. They can reduce traffic between an application and the database server by bundling commands
* Normalisation - systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy (repetition) and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies. It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form by removing duplicated data from the relational tables
* Redundancy - when the same piece of data is stored in two or more separate places
* Comprehensive Data Types
* Constraint Implementations
* Indexing Strategies - Indexing strategies involve creating indexes on tables to speed up the retrieval of rows at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structures
* Indices - Indices are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval.
* Database Business Requirements - what the business intends to achieve with the database
* Database User requirements - what the end-users need the database to do

## ACID and the Importance of Transactions
### Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
* Atomicity - Each transation is a single unit that succeeds or fails completely.
* Consistency - Only valid data is saved
* Isolation - Transactions do not not affect each other
* Durability - Written data will not be loss (even in power failure etc).

  
## Writing Nested (Sub) CRUD SQL Queries
* Nested Create -  complex 'CREATE' operations can involve subqueries to define or populate new tables based on existing data. For example, creating a new table that aggregates existing customer data but only includes those who meet certain spending thresholds
* Nested Read - For example, selecting customer data where the customerâ€™s spending is above the average within their demographic
* Nested Update - For instance, increasing the price of products in a catalogue only if their stock levels are below a certain threshold.
* Nested Delete - For example, deleting records of a promotional campaign that did not reach any customers in specific regions.

## Nested Vs Correlated Queries
Subquery (nested) - Executed within another query. Inner query runs fist, providing results to outer.<br/>
Correlated Query - 

### Key Differences 
Nested queries run once, correlated queries run for each outer row. Correlated queries can be slower due to repeat executions. Subqueries are independent. Correlated queries rely on the outer query.


## Joins and Database Normalisation
## GroupBy, Aggregation, and Windowing in SQL

### SQL Window Functions
* Windowing Functions - Window functions operate on a set of rows and return a single value for each row from the underlying query. This is useful for running totals, moving averages, and other cumulative or comparative statistics.
* Over Clause - Specifies the partitioning and ordering of a data set before the window function is applied.
* Running Totals and Averages
* Frame Specification - Allows the window to be defined over a range of rows relative to the current row, providing flexible data analysis options.

## Risks and Disaster Recovery, Shards in Database Systems
* Risk Assessment
* Disaster Recovery Planning - maintaining backups, having redundant systems in place, and ensuring that staff are trained in recovery procedures
* Continuous Monitoring and Testing - Regular testing of disaster recovery procedures to ensure they are effective when needed.
* Sharding for Scalability and Performance - dividing a larger database into smaller, more manageable pieces, or "shards," which can be spread across multiple servers
* Horizontal Partitioning - Each shard contains the same schema with a different subset of data.
* Load Distribution - By distributing the data across multiple shards, which can be hosted on separate hardware or networked servers, sharding helps in balancing the load and reducing the response time for data queries.
* Data Locality
