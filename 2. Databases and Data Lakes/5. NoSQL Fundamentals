# Understanding NoSQL Databases

## The need for Not Only SQL Databases
Example of Apple, Fitbit and Android health tracking. Some fields present in one, not the other. SQL relational database would include lots of nulls from the left join.
Data is stored more in data-value pairs, like JSON.


# Types of NoSQL Databases
## NoSQL data storage models:
* Document: JSON. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. 
The values can typically be a variety of types including strings, 
numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects, and their structure doesn't have to be predefined.<br/>
e.g. MongoDB
* Key Value: Simplest type. Each item in the DB is stored as an attribute name(key) together with its value.<br/>
e.g. Redis. Shopping cart application. 
* Wide-Column/Column Family: Dynamic columns. store data in columns instead of rows which can be quickly searched and aggregated. best for analysing large datasets
* Graph: Nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between entities. They are ideal for handling data where relationships are at the core, like social networks,
