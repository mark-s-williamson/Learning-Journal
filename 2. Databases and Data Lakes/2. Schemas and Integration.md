# Comparison of SQL Databases
## PostgreSQL
widely-used open-source relational database system known for its robustness and flexibility in handling complex SQL operations
## Amazon Redshift
* a cloud-based data warehousing service optimised for online analytical processing (OLAP) tasks 
* integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it a preferable choice for businesses already embedded within the AWS ecosystem


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Redshift is designed to handle large scale data analytics workflows more efficiently than PostgreSQL due to its columnar storage and parallel query execution. <br/>
While both Redshift and PostgreSQL support SQL, there are variations in their SQL dialects and extensions.
