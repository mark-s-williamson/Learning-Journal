# Understanding NoSQL Databases

## The need for Not Only SQL Databases
Example of Apple, Fitbit and Android health tracking. Some fields present in one, not the other. SQL relational database would include lots of nulls from the left join.
Data is stored more in data-value pairs, like JSON.


# Types of NoSQL Databases
## NoSQL data storage models:
* Document: JSON. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. 
The values can typically be a variety of types including strings, 
numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects, and their structure doesn't have to be predefined.<br/>
e.g. MongoDB
* Key Value: Simplest type. Each item in the DB is stored as an attribute name(key) together with its value.<br/>
e.g. Redis. Shopping cart application. 
* Wide-Column/Column Family: Dynamic columns. store data in columns instead of rows which can be quickly searched and aggregated. best for analysing large datasets
* Graph: Nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between entities. They are ideal for handling data where relationships are at the core, like social networks,

## Popular NoSQL Databases:
* MongoDB
* Cassandra
* Google Cloud Bigtable
* Apache HBase


# Discovering MongoDB
## MongoDB Structure
* Documents: KVPs. Analagous to rows in a SQL table
* Collections: Analagous to tables in SQL. Holds documents. does not require the documents to have the same schema.

### Documents: Stores records as Binary JSON (BSON) documents.
## NoSQL Data Retrieval:
* Scraping Web Pages
* Parsing Text
* Interfacing with APIs
* Reading Metadata

## NoSQL Data Transformation
* Nature of Data: Undefined
* Data Cleaning: <br/>   Text: Remove stop words, stemming<br/>   Images: Resize, Normalise
* Data Enrichment: Extract metadata. Sentiment Analysis. Features from Images
* Data Transformation:<br/>   Text: Convert to Numerical Format<br/>   Images: Convert to Pixel Values
* Schema Evolution: Flexible, but hard to ensure consistency
* Complexity: Complexity in pre-processing and converting to structured format.
* Tools and libraries: <br/>   Text: NLTK, spaCy<br/>   Images: OpenCV, TensorFlow


# Unstructured Data from MongoDB to SQL
## Transformation Challenges:
* Data Quality - Solution: Data cleaning using tools like Pandas
* Computational Intensity - Solution: Use efficient algorithms or distribute computation.
* Evolution of Data - Regular review of transformation logic and maintain modular code.

## Loading Challenges
* Scalability - Solution: Opt for Scalable databases or partitioning strategies
* Data Integrity - Data validation checks before loading
* Performance - Regular indexing and query optimisation

## Transition from MongoDB to SQL
* Evaluation - mapping the collections and structures to relational schemas
* Transformation - Flattening nested documents or normalising data into tables.
* Migration - MongoDB connector
* Validation
* Optimisation - check your indices
* Continuous Sync
