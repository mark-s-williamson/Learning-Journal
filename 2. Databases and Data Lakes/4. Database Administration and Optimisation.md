# Database Administration Best Practices
* Scalability
* Performance
* Data Consistency
* Transaction

 Designing for scalability and performance involves considering:

    Data volume and growth rate, 
    Query patterns and performance, 
    Partitioning and sharding, 
    Caching mechanisms, 
    Monitoring and performance tuning. 

## Database Performance Metrics
* Query Performance
* User and Query Conflicts
* Business Transactions
* Capacity
* Configureation (eg. buffer and query caches).

### Tips to increase Database Performance
1: Optimise Queries
2: Improve Indices
3: Defragment Data
4: Increase Memory
5: Strengthen CPU
6: Review Access

## Security
* Authentication
* Authorisation and access control
* Data Encryption
* Data Privacy Protection
* Data Integrity Verification
* Auditing and Logging
  
# SQL and NoSQL Databases
SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. Tables consist of rows (records) and columns (fields), with each column having a specific data type. NoSQL is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Uses non relational data models, such as key-value stores. Schemaless or Schema-on-read approach. designed for horizontal scalability across multiple servers, with a distributed architecture for handling large-scale data. prioritise eventual consistency, relaxing strict consistency in favour of availability and partition tolerance. This allows for temporary inconsistencies that are eventually resolved.

## Database Changes: Impacts and Costs
* Datastream - Can affect downstream applications and users.
* Schema - Big potential issue in SQL, less of an issue in NoSQL
* Data Format
* Performance
* Processing and Storage Costs - SQL lower storage costs, potentially higher processing costs for complex operations.

# Monitoring and Optimising Database Performance
## Metrics:
* Response Time
* Throughput
* Concurrency
* Resource Utilisation
* Indexing

## Learning Journal Task:
**In your learning journal, research the third-party database monitoring solutions that your company uses.**


### Query Profiling (Query Logging and Analysis)
### Indexing Strategies
Indexing strategies focus on creating appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns, choosing the right index types based on data characteristics and query patterns, and monitoring index usage and performance to identify redundant or underutilised indexes.
### Database Configuration
memory allocation, buffer sizes, caching mechanisms, and parallelism settings

## Horizontal Vs Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling involves adding resources (CPU, memory, storage). Horizontal Scaling, or Sharding, distributes data across multiple servers.
