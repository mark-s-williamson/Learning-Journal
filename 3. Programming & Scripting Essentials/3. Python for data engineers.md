# Python for data Engineers

## Introduction to the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

* planning - Define Scope, purpose, stakeholders and objectives
* analysis - Detailed requirements gathered
* design - creating architecture and design
* development - actual coding
* testing - verifying works as intended
* deployment - send to prod
* maintenance - monitor and update


## Introduction to Python Basics
### Variables
In python you do not need to declare a variable before using it. Variable type determined at runtime<br/>
e.g <br/>
Message = "Hello, World!"<br/>
Number = 42
### Functions
def add(a, b):<br/>

     return a + b<br/>

result = add(3, 4)<br/>

print(result)   # Outputs: 7<br/>

**Indenting is important as part of the function**

### Reserved Key Words

### Control Flow


## Introduction to Test Driven Development
Tests written before code. Also known as Red, Green, Refactor
* Red - Test is intended to fail because feature is not implemented
* Green - Just Enough code to make the test pass
* Refactor - Improve the code while ensuring all tests still pass
