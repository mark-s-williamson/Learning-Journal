# Data Structures and OOP

## Python's primary data structures

### Fundamental Types:
Integers, Floats, Strings Booleans<br/>
- Integers: whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero<br/>
- Floats: numbers that have a decimal point<br/>
- Strings<br/>
- Booleans: True or False<br/>

### Non Fundamental Types:
Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets<br/>
List - Ordered, Changeable, Can store different Types<br/>
Tuples - Like lists, but immutable<br/>3
Dictionaries - Key Value Pairs <br/>
Sets - <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Identifiers - The names given to variables, collections, functions, classes etc. Must start with a letter or underscore. Can only include alphanumeric and underscore

## Lists and Dictionaries

### Lists
An ordered collection of items that can contain elements of mixed types. Unlike basic data types, lists allow us to hold multiple items in a single structure, making it easier to perform operations on them as a group. <br/>
 ** Use Case**
 Ordered, Allows Duplicates, Mutable

### Dictionaries
An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries can store various types of data: numbers, strings, lists, and even other dictionaries. 
 ** Use Case**
 UnOrdered, Fast Lookups. Keys are immutable, but KVPs can be removed.
 
 ### Collections
 containers that are used to store multiple elements, such as lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples
 
 ### Data Structures
 includes collections but also encompasses other ways of organising and storing data, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
 
 ## Advanced Python collections:
 ### Sets
 **Definition:** unordered collection of unique elements<br/>
 **Use Cases:** membership testing, eliminating duplicate entries, and performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference<br/>
 **Example:** unique_numbers = {1,2,3,4,5}<br/>
 ### Frozen Sets
 **Definition:** immutable version of a set<br/>
 **Use Cases:** immutability is required, such as keys in dictionaries<br/>
 **Example:** frozen_unique_numbers = frozenset([1,2,3,4,5])<br/>
 ### Named Tuples
 **Definition:** an extension of the regular tuple that allows you to name the elements, improving code readability<br/>
 **Use Cases:** where you need tuples but also want to access elements by name rather than index<br/>
 **Example:** from collections import namedtuple Point = namedtuple('Point',['x', 'y']) p = Point (1,2)<br/>
  ### OrderedDict
 **Definition:** a dictionary that maintains the order of items based on insertion order<br/>
 **Use Cases:** when the order of items is important, such as in LRU (Least Recently Used) caches<br/>
 **Example:** from collections import OrderedDict od = OrderedDict() od['a'] = 1 od['b'] = 2<br/>
 
 ## Data serialisation and coding conventions
 Data serialisation allows you to convert complex data structures into a format that can be easily saved to a file or sent over a network. 
 Data Serialisation is the process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. 
 Common formats for serialisation include JSON, XML, and binary formats.
 
 ### Benefits of Data serialisation
 **Data Persistence** Can save the state of an object to a file or database<br/>
 **Data Exchange** Can be shred easily between systems, platforms or applications<br/>
 **Perfoamance** Serialised data can be efficiently transmitted.<br/>
 
 ## Serialisation formats
 ### JSON
 **Definition:** <br/>
 **Use Cases:** commonly used for web APIs, configuration files, and data exchange between different programming languages<br/>
 **Example:**  python import json data = {'name;: 'Alice', 'age': 25} json_str = json.dumps(data) <br/>
 ### Pickle
 **Definition:** Python-specific binary serialisation format that can serialise and deserialise Python objects<br/>
 **Use Cases:** saving complex Python objects, such as models in machine learning, to disk<br/>
 **Example:**   <br/>
  ### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
 **Definition:** a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable<br/>
 **Use Cases:** configuration files, data interchange between systems, and web services.<br/>
 **Example:**  <br/>
 
 ## PEP8 Coding conventions
 ### Indentation
 **Definition** Python uses indentation to define code blocks, and PEP 8 recommends using 4 spaces per indentation level<br/>
 **Details** Consistent indentation is crucial for readability and avoiding syntax errors.<br/>
 ### Line Length
 **Definition** Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters<br/>
 **Details** Breaking long lines improves readability and prevents horizontal scrolling<br/>
 ### Naming Conventions
 **Definition** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.<br/>
 **Details** Descriptive names enhance code clarity and make it self-documenting.<br/>
 ### Whitespace
 **Definition** Use whitespace to improve readability, but avoid extraneous whitespace.<br/>
 **Details** Proper use of whitespace around operators, after commas, and before and after functions improves code readability.<br/>
 ### Comments
 **Definition** Use comments to explain code and provide context, but keep them concise and relevant.<br/>
 **Details** Comments should be used judiciously to clarify complex logic or assumptions, not to state the obvious.<br/>
 
 ## Object Oriented Programming
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. <br/>
 Objects are instances of classes, which can contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions). <br/>
 OOP focuses on encapsulating data and behaviour within objects, promoting modularity and reusability. <br/>

 ### Encapsulation
 Each Object keeps its state private inside a class. Other objects can't directly access them, but can call a list of public functions called methods. The object manages its own state via methods. <br/>
 ### Abstraction
 Abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.<br/>
 ###Inheritance
 Inheritance means that you create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we form a hierarchy.<br/>
 ### Polymorphism
 polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.<br/>

This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods.<br/>
Any time a collection (such as a list) or a method expects an instance of the parent (where common methods are outlined), the language takes care of evaluating the right implementation of the common method — regardless of which child is passed.<br/>

## Design Patterns
Design Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices used by experienced developers to solve specific problems in a structured and efficient manner.<br/>

### Benefits of Design Patterns
**Reusability**: Design patterns provide reusable solutions that can be applied to similar problems across different projects<br/>
**Scalability**: They help in designing scalable systems that can grow and adapt to changing requirements<br/>
**Maintainability**: Design patterns make code easier to maintain by providing clear and well-documented approaches to common problems<br/>
**Communication**: They improve communication among developers by providing a shared vocabulary and understanding of best practices<br/>
