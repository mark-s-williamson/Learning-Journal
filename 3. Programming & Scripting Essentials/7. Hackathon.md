## Parallelism
Concurrency vs Parallelism. Concurrency is two tasks at the same time, sharing resources. Queue system. Parallel is two tasks at the same time, but using different resources<br/>
## Multi Processing vs Multi Threading
Multiprocessing seperates main process into sub processes that each have distinct resource (CPU/Memory) allocation. Multithreading breaks the main process into threads that share resources.<br/><br/>
Multithread achieves Concurrency, Multiprocessing achieves Parallelism.<br/>
Kernel Scheduling - The kernel of the OS schedules threads to multiple cores.
## Concurrency Fundamentals
## Fork-Join Model
### Data Parallelism vs Task Parallelism
Files partitioned vs Intact
Same operations  vs different operations
Number of threads / processes is dependent on data size vs number of threads / processes is determined by the developer


# Spark
For accessing large scale data distributed across clusters.

RDD:Resilient Distributed Datasets.  Big dataset is partitioned into worker nodes. Driver node co-ordinates.
