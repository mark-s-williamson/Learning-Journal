## Parallelism
Concurrency vs Parallelism. Concurrency is two tasks at the same time, sharing resources. Queue system. Parallel is two tasks at the same time, but using different resources<br/>
## Multi Processing vs Multi Threading
Multiprocessing seperates main process into sub processes that each have distinct resource (CPU/Memory) allocation. Multithreading breaks the main process into threads that share resources.<br/><br/>
Multithread achieves Concurrency, Multiprocessing achieves Parallelism.<br/>
Kernel Scheduling - The kernel of the OS schedules threads to multiple cores.
## Concurrency Fundamentals
## Parallel Computing Fundamentals
## Practical application
