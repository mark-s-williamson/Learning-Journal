# Algorithmic thinking
## An introduction to algorithmic thinking
### Sorting Algorithms
 - Bubble Sort - Going down the line and swapping each pair
 - Quick Sort - Selecting at random, assigning as pivot separating everything else to larger/smaller. Then repeating.
 - Merge Sort - Once first split as above, you merge the two halves back together in order and repeat.
## Software development tools and techniques
## Constructing efficient algorithms
### Time Complexity
Constant time, Linear, Quadratic etc
### Space Efficiency
### Resource Usage
## Advanced algorithmic techniques
### Graph algorithms
- Shortest path algorithms
- Cycle Detection algorithms
- Network flow algorithms
### String algorithms
- Pattern Matching Algorithms - **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** and **Boyer-Moore**. <br/>
KMP uses a prefix function. B-M skips ahead based on mismatched characters.
- Substring Search Algorithms - **Rabin-Karp** uses hashtag to identify matched substrings.
- String Compression Algorithms - **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** replace repeated characters with a count
### Advanced Data Structures
- HEAPS (Priority Queues) - Min-Heap, smallest element at the top. Max heap, largest element at the top.
- Tries (Prefix Trees) - Each level represents a character. Branches down like a dictionary.
- Segment Trees (Interval Trees)
