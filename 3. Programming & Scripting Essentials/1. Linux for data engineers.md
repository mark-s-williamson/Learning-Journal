# What is Linux and Why use it?
* Open source operating system. Linux Foundation is Non Profit.
* Command Line Interface (CLI)/Shell
* Stable and Reliable. Able to run for long periods without reboot.
* Open Source nature means security issues are recognised quickly.
* Flexibile Distros for different uses

## Linux system structure
![Linux structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50a1aead-2425-498f-af68-4448f6a4c6d1)

* Hardware
* Kernel - Core part of Linux that manages system resources such as drivers and power usage
* Shell - Interface that allows users to interact witth the kernel and with applications
* Applications - Terminal to execute commands (more examples?)

  
# Navigating the Linux file system
## File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
* Filesystem
* Directories
* Files

![FHS File directory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74f5a994-ef13-4e4a-8562-0341972bace7)


## Key Directories
 Directories 
* /bin (Binaries) - essential binary executables that are required for the system to boot and run in single-user mode. These are fundamental commands available to all users and necessary for basic system functionality.
* /etc (Configuration Files) -  all the system-wide configuration files and shell scripts that are used to boot and initialise system settings. This is where system administrators can configure the system's behaviour.
* /home (Home Directories) - default location for users' personal directories
* /usr (User Binaries and Read-Only data) - user utilities and applications that are not essential for the system to boot or operate in single-user mode<br/>
  - Subdirectories<br/>
  - /usr/bin: Non-essential command binaries like python
  - /usr/lib: Libraries for binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
  - /usr/share: Architecture independent data (like documentation, icons)
  - /usr/local: Locally installed software and custom scripts
* /var (Variable Data): Variable data files expected to grow over time.

## Popular commands:
* ls - list contents of a directory
* cd - Change directory
* pwd - display path (of) working directory

## Key File Operations
* touch - create an empty file or update timestamp of a file
* rm - remove file/directory
* mv - move or rename
* cp - copy

# Key Linux utilities for data engineers
* Global regular expression print (grep): Search for patterns within files
* Stream Editor (Sed): Modify file content
* awk: Pattern scanning and processing language

### Grep:
 - Basic Usage: to search for error in a log file named application.log you would use -- _grep "error" application.log_
 - Case-insensitive search: -- _grep -i "error" application.log_
 - Multiple Keywords: -- _grep -E "error|fail|exception" application.log_ -- or -- _grep -e "error" -e "fail" -e "exception" application.log_
 - Contextual search:  adds _**n**_ lines of code before and after each match -- _grep -C 2 "error" application.log_
 - Count: _grep -c "error" application.log_
 - Display Line Numbers: _grep -n "error" application.log_

### Combination example: 
_grep -i -n -C -E "error|fail|exception" application.log_ this would search for error, fail or exception in a case-insensitive way, shows 2 lines before and after and the line numbers

### Data Transfer and compression tools:
* rsync - synchronises files and directories between two locations
* tar and gzip - archiving and compressing files

# Job Scheduling and automation
## Cron Jobs
A cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specified intervals. The syntax for defining a cron job consists of five fields, which represent the minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week when the task should execute. These fields are separated by spaces and use special symbols to denote specific values
* Minute (0-59)
* Hour (0-23)
* Day of the month (1-31)
* Month (1-12)
* Day of the week (0-6) (0 is Sunday)
Example cron job to run a backup script every day at 2.30:<br/>
_**30 2 * * * /path/to/backup-script.sh**_

## Crontab
Crontabis a command-line utility used to schedule cron jobs. Each user can have their own crontab file and there is a system-wide crontab.<br/>
To submit a cron job, you use the crontab command with the -e flag, which opens the crontab file for editing. 

## Writing and executing simple scripts in Linux
### Creating a script file
- Open a text editor and create a new file with an .sh extension. _**nano myscript.sh **_
- Specify the shebang (shell interpreter). To use a bash shell: **_#!/bin/bash_**
- Write commands. eg. to print Hello world and list the files in the current directory:  _**echo "Hello, World!"**_<br/>
 _**ls -l**_
- Save and Exit: Ctrl+x
- Make the script executable: _**chmod +x myscript.sh**_
- Run the Script: **_./myscript.sh_**

### Additional Tips
- Redirection Operators direct the output of an echo to a file instead of the terminal
- **>** - Single Redirect: Outputs to a file, overwrites file if exists, creates new file if it does not.
- **>>** - Append Redirect: Outputs to a file, appends to end of file if exists, creates new file if it does not.
- Pipes - directs the output of an echo as an input to another command
- **_ ls -l | grep "txt"_** lists files and directories and passes that output to the grep command which will search that list for txt files.
