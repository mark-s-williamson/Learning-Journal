# What is Linux and Why use it?
* Open source operating system. Linux Foundation is Non Profit.
* Command Line Interface (CLI)/Shell
* Stable and Reliable. Able to run for long periods without reboot.
* Open Source nature means security issues are recognised quickly.
* Flexibile Distros for different uses

## Linux system structure
![Linux structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50a1aead-2425-498f-af68-4448f6a4c6d1)

* Hardware
* Kernel - Core part of Linux that manages system resources such as drivers and power usage
* Shell - Interface that allows users to interact witth the kernel and with applications
* Applications - Terminal to execute commands (more examples?)

  
# Navigating the Linux file system
## File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
* Filesystem
* Directories
* Files

![FHS File directory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74f5a994-ef13-4e4a-8562-0341972bace7)


## Key Directories
 Directories 
* /bin (Binaries) - essential binary executables that are required for the system to boot and run in single-user mode. These are fundamental commands available to all users and necessary for basic system functionality.
* /etc (Configuration Files) -  all the system-wide configuration files and shell scripts that are used to boot and initialise system settings. This is where system administrators can configure the system's behaviour.
* /home (Home Directories) - default location for users' personal directories
* /usr (User Binaries and Read-Only data) - user utilities and applications that are not essential for the system to boot or operate in single-user mode<br/>
  - Subdirectories<br/>
  - /usr/bin: Non-essential command binaries like python
  - /usr/lib: Libraries for binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
  - /usr/share: Architecture independent data (like documentation, icons)
  - /usr/local: Locally installed software and custom scripts
* /var (Variable Data): Variable data files expected to grow over time.

## Popular commands:
* ls - list contents of a directory
* cd - Change directory
* pwd - display path (of) working directory

## Key File Operations
* touch - create an empty file or update timestamp of a file
* rm - remove file/directory
* mv - move or rename
* cp - copy

# Key Linux utilities for data engineers
* Global regular expression print (grep): Search for patterns within files
* Stream Editor (Sed): Modify file content
* awk: Pattern scanning and processing language

### Grep:
 - Basic Usage: to search for error in a log file named application.log you would use -- _grep "error" application.log_
 - Case-insensitive search: -- _grep -i "error" application.log_
 - Multiple Keywords: -- _grep -E "error|fail|exception" application.log_ -- or -- _grep -e "error" -e "fail" -e "exception" application.log_
 - Contextual search:  adds _**n**_ lines of code before and after each match -- _grep -C 2 "error" application.log_
 - Count: _grep -c "error" application.log_
 - Display Line Numbers: _grep -n "error" application.log_

### Combination example: _grep -i -n -C -E "error|fail|exception" application.log_ this would search for error, fail or exception in a case-insensitive way, shows 2 lines before and after and the line numbers

### Data Transfer and compression tools:
* rsync - synchronises files and directories between two locations
* tar and gzip - archiving and compressing files

# Job Scheduling and automation
# Advanced text processing and log management.
