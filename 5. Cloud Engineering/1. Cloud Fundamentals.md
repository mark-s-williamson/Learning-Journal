# Developing an evaluating security policies
Access control
Data protection
Incident response

Preventative policies - eg. patching
Detective policies - e.g fair use policy
Corrective Poilicies - e.g incident response policy

General Information Security policy
Access security policy
Authentication policy
Password policy
Perimeter Security Policy
Cybersecurity policy
Cloud Security policy
Patching policy
Physical Access policy

How to prepare a security policy

1: Identify the business purpose for having a specific type of IT security policy
2: Secure approval from Senior Management
3: Adapt existing security policies
4: Establish a project plan
5: Create a team
6: Schedule management briefings
7: Invite internal departments (legal/HR) to review policy
8: Invite risk management team
9: Distribute draft for final review
10: Secure management approval and disseminate
11: Establish a review and change process
12: Schedule and prepare for annual audits
13: Make policy widely accessible



# Implementing risk mitigation strategies
How do you implement policies?
1: **Assess Needs:** Determine which systems and data require MFA.
2: **Select Methods:** Choose appropriate authentication factors (e.g., SMS codes, authentication apps, biometrics). A successful MFA approach uses a combination of something you know (password), something you have (smartphone), and something you are (biometrics) for MFA. Ensure user convenience while implementing MFA to avoid resistance to adoption.
3: **Rollout:** Implement MFA across the organization, starting with high-risk areas.
4: **Monitor and adjust:** Continuously monitor the effectiveness of MFA and make adjustments as needed.

How do you implement security control?
1: Draft policy
2: Invite internal departments
3: Educate users
4: Publish

Types of Security Assessments
1: Vulnerability Scanning
2: Penetration Testing
3: Risk Assessments

Patch Management process
1: Inventory systems
2: Monitor for updates
3: Test Patches
4: Deploy Patches
5: Verify and Document

# Learning from security incidents and near-misses

why document security incidents?

    1: Accountability: Proper documentation holds individuals and teams accountable for their actions during an incident.
    2: Learning and Improvement: Detailed records help identify patterns and recurring issues, facilitating continuous improvement.
    3: Compliance: Many regulations require detailed incident reporting. Compliance ensures that the organisation avoids penalties and maintains trust.
    4: Communication: Documentation helps communicate the nature and impact of incidents to stakeholders, including management, clients, and regulatory bodies.

Steps for documenting security incidents
1: Incident Detection
2: Initial response
3: Incident Analysis
4: Mitigation and Recovery
5: Post-Incident review

Using incident documentation to enhance future response
1: Update Response Plans
2: Train Personnel
3: Improve Communication
4: Utilise Technology
5: Conduct Regular Reviews
