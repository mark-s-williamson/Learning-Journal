# Cyber Security Essentials

## Understanding the CIA Triad
### Confidentiality
### Integrity
### Availability

## The Triple A Model
### Authentication
### Authorisation
### Accounting

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
* What you know - Login credentials
* What you have - Approve/Deny Verification Request
* What you are - Confirm Identity with a unique marker
* Your location - Authenticate using time or location



## Vulnerabilities and Risks
Risk = Probability x Severity

## Understanding Threats and Attacks

Attacks:<br/>
**SQL Injection**: An attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into an input field for execution, 
allowing attackers to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. <br/>
Example: An attacker enters SQL code into a login form to bypass authentication and gain unauthorised access to user accounts<br/>
**Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic. <br/>
Example: Flooding a website with requests until it crashes, making it unavailable to users.<br/>
**Ransomware**: Malicious software that locks or encrypts files on a victim's computer, demanding a ransom for their release.<br/>
Example: The WannaCry attack in 2017, which encrypted data on infected computers and demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin.<br/>
**Zero-Day**: An attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in software before the vendor has issued a patch. <br/>
Example: Stuxnet exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. <br/>
**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: A DoS attack where multiple compromised systems attack a single target, causing a denial of service for users.  <br/>
Example: The Mirai botnet used hundreds of thousands of IoT devices to perform a massive DDoS attack in 2016.<br/>
**Trojan Horse**: Malicious software that misleads users of its true intent, often appearing as a legitimate program to deceive users into installing it. <br/>
Example: A fake antivirus program that claims to find infections on the user's computer and prompts them to purchase a full version to remove them.<br/>
**Malware**: Any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, or computer network. Types of malware include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. <br/>
Example: A worm that replicates itself to spread to other computers, often exploiting vulnerabilities in network software.<br/>
**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**: An attack where the attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other.<br/>
 Example: Intercepting communication between a user and a banking website to steal login credentials.<br/>


## Security Controls
**Preventive Controls**: <br/>Firewalls, encryption, and access controls.<br/>
**Detective Controls**: <br/>Intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and regular audits.<br/>
**Corrective Controls**: <br/>Incident response plans, patch management, and disaster recovery plans.<br/>
**Firewalls**:<br/> Act as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.<br/>
**Security Policies**:<br/> Written documents that define an organisationâ€™s security practices and procedures, such as clean desk policies and social media policies.<br/>
**Staff Training**:<br/>Regular training sessions to educate employees on security best practices and how to respond to security incidents.<br/>

### Symmetric encryption vs asymmetric encryption
Symmetric: Both parties use the same key to encrypt/decrypt.<br/>
Asymmetric: Different keys to encrypt/decrypt<br/>
Public key is a locked mailbox. Private key is the key that opens the mailbox.

## Evaluating the impact of Security breaches


## Access Control Mechanism
Subject: User, Non-Person Entity
Access Control Mechanism: (Role Based Access, Read Only, )
Object: File/Data/Resource
