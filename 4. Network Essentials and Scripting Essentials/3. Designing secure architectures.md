# The Three Phases of Cybersecurity Architecture

## 1: Develop
To design a robust cybersecurity framework tailored to the organisationâ€™s needs. <br/>
identifying the organisation's specific security requirements, assessing risks, and defining security policies and procedures. <br/>
During this phase, architects will reference established standards and best practices such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, etc.  <br/> <br/>

Data Protection <br/>
Access Control <br/>
Risk Management <br/>
## 2: Implement
To deploy the cybersecurity measures designed in the development phase. <br/>
This involves setting up technical controls like firewalls, antivirus software, encryption tools, and intrusion detection systems.<br/>

Administrative controls, such as security policies, training programmes, and incident response plans, are also established. <br/>

## 3: Monitor
To ensure the ongoing effectiveness and efficiency of the cybersecurity measures.<br/>
Real-time monitoring of systems and networks for any unusual activities or potential security incidents.<br/>
Tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, automated threat detection, and regular audits are employed. <br/>
Continuous monitoring allows for the timely detection of vulnerabilities and threats, ensuring that security measures remain effective against evolving risks. <br/>


# Secure Network design

### Least Privilege Access
Limit user and device access rights to only those necessary for performing a defined set of tasks.
This minimises the potential damage from accidental or malicious actions. 

### Defence in Depth (Layered Security)

### Network segmentation

### Secure by default
Unnecessary services and features should be disabled to minimise potential vulnerabilities.

### Zero trust architecture
Verify the identity and integrity of devices, users, and software at all times, regardless of location.

### encryption

### Regular updates and patch management

### Intrusion detection and prevention

### Comprehensive monitoring and logging

### Resilience and redundancy
redundant network paths, failover systems, and regular backups.

### Secure Remote Access

### Security Awareness and training


# The Five Rules of Networking
1: redundancy
2: scalability
3: security
4: manageability
5: functionality



# Defence in Depth (DID) and Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA)

## Defence in Depth:
Device > Application > Computer > Network > Physical > Policies, Procedures & Awareness


## Zero Trust: 
### Verify Every User
Continuous checks throughout the session.
### Validate Their devices
### Intelligently Limit their Access


## Micro Segmenting and Advanced Security Layers
Micro-segmenting involves using software-defined networking (SDN) to create very small, isolated segments within a network.<br/>

# Firewalls and DMZ
Network firewalls are critical components of network security, acting as barriers between internal networks and external threats. <br/>
They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules<br/>

### Proxy firewalls (Application Level Gateways)
Proxy firewalls act as intermediaries between users and the internet, making network requests on behalf of users
### Next Generation firewalls
combine the capabilities of traditional firewalls with additional features like application awareness and control, integrated intrusion prevention, and cloud-delivered threat intelligence.
### Unified Threat Management
includes antivirus, anti-spam, network firewall functions, intrusion detection and prevention, content filtering, and VPN capabilities
### Web Application firewalls
protect web applications by monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. <br/>
They apply a set of rules to HTTP conversation to cover common attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection


## Common Firewall Designs

### Public and Private
Small Office/Home Office - Public network (outside network) is untrusted and inside network is trusted.
### DMZ Security Architecture
A DMZ is a physical or logical subnet that separates an internal local area network (LAN) from untrusted external networks, usually the internet. 
### Zone Based Policy firewalls
By default, the traffic between interfaces in the same zone is not subject to any policy and passes freely. <br/>
However, all zone-to-zone traffic is blocked. In order to permit traffic between zones, a policy allowing or inspecting traffic must be configured.


# Additional security considerations
### Intrusion Detection System
IDS appliances can be signature-based (detecting known patterns of malicious activity) or anomaly-based (detecting deviations from normal traffic patterns).
### Intrusion Prevention System
an IPS is placed in-line and can automatically block or prevent such activities as they are detected, offering proactive protection.
### Virtual Private Network appliance
provide secure remote access to a network or between networks over the Internet by encrypting connections
### Secure Web Gateway
protect users from web-based threats and enforce company policies through web filtering, application control, and malware inspection. 
### Data Loss prevention
focused on detecting and preventing the unauthorized use and transmission of confidential information
### Private VLANs
PVLANs are used to segment the network at the data link layer (Layer 2). They allow for isolation between hosts within the same VLAN
### Storm controls
prevents disruptions on a switch port caused by broadcast, multicast, or unicast storms


# Advanced encryption
Hardware Security Modules and Key Management services


## Hardware Security Modules
A dedicated hardware devices designed to generate, store and manage encryption keys.

### Key Management services
a cloud-based service that provides secure key management capabilities

## Detailed attack surface management
