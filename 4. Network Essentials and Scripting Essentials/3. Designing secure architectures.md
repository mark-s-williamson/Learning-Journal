# The Three Phases of Cybersecurity Architecture

## 1: Develop
To design a robust cybersecurity framework tailored to the organisationâ€™s needs. <br/>
identifying the organisation's specific security requirements, assessing risks, and defining security policies and procedures. <br/>
During this phase, architects will reference established standards and best practices such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, etc.  <br/> <br/>

Data Protection <br/>
Access Control <br/>
Risk Management <br/>
## 2: Implement
To deploy the cybersecurity measures designed in the development phase. <br/>
This involves setting up technical controls like firewalls, antivirus software, encryption tools, and intrusion detection systems.<br/>

Administrative controls, such as security policies, training programmes, and incident response plans, are also established. <br/>

## 3: Monitor
To ensure the ongoing effectiveness and efficiency of the cybersecurity measures.<br/>
Real-time monitoring of systems and networks for any unusual activities or potential security incidents.<br/>
Tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, automated threat detection, and regular audits are employed. <br/>
Continuous monitoring allows for the timely detection of vulnerabilities and threats, ensuring that security measures remain effective against evolving risks. <br/>


# Secure Network design

### Least Privilege Access
Limit user and device access rights to only those necessary for performing a defined set of tasks.
This minimises the potential damage from accidental or malicious actions. 

### Defence in Depth (Layered Security)

### Network segmentation

### Secure by default
Unnecessary services and features should be disabled to minimise potential vulnerabilities.

### Zero trust architecture
Verify the identity and integrity of devices, users, and software at all times, regardless of location.

### encryption

### Regular updates and patch management

### Intrusion detection and prevention

### Comprehensive monitoring and logging

### Resilience and redundancy
redundant network paths, failover systems, and regular backups.

### Secure Remote Access

### Security Awareness and training


# The Five Rules of Networking
1: redundancy
2: scalability
3: security
4: manageability
5: functionality
