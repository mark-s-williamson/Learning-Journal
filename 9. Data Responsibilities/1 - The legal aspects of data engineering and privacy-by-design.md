## Understanding Privacy-by-Design

### Core Principle 1 Proactive, Not Reactive
- Focuses on identifying and addressing risks during development rather than responding to breaches after they occur.

### Core Principle 2 Privacy Embedded into Design
- Privacy must be integrated into every aspect of a system, not added later.

### Core Principle 3 End-to-End Security
- Ensures data remains secure at all stages, from collection to deletion.

## Techniques for Embedding Privacy into Data Systems

### Technique 1 Data Minimisation
- Systems should collect and process only the data necessary for their purpose.

### Technique 2 Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)
- Tools such as encryption, differential privacy, and pseudonymisation protect sensitive data while maintaining usability.

### Technique 3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Ensures users only access data needed for their roles, reducing unnecessary exposure.

## Tools and Frameworks for Privacy-by-Design

### Data Encryption Tools
- Convert data into unreadable formats that can only be accessed by authorised parties.

### Privacy Management Software
- Automates compliance, tracks consent, and assesses privacy risks.

### NIST Framework  UK Cyber Governance Code of Practice
- Provide structured guidance for implementing strong cybersecurity and privacy-by-design practices.
