# Event-Driven Architectures

- **Events**: Changes in state.  
- **Event Producers**: Entities that generate events.  
- **Event Brokers**: Middleware that routes events from producers to consumers.  
- **Event Consumers**: Services that listen for and process events.

# Pub-Sub Model and Messaging

- **Publishers**: Entities that send messages about events to specific topics, agnostic of listeners.  
- **Subscribers**: Entities that express an interest in one or more topics and receive messages.  
- **Topics**: Named channels where messages are published and subscribed to.  

## Advantages of the Pub-Sub Model

- **Decoupling producers and consumers**: Enhances flexibility and scalability.  
- **Efficient broadcasting**: Messages are routed only to interested subscribers â€” and to all interested subscribers.  
- **Scalability**: Can easily handle increasing numbers of publishers and subscribers.

# Apache Kafka

- **Topics and Partitions**  
  - *Topics*: Categories or feed names to which messages are published.  
  - *Partitions*: Subdivisions of topics that allow Kafka to parallelize message processing.  
    - Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to.  

- **Producers and Consumers**  
  - *Producers*: Applications that write data to topics.  
  - *Consumers*: Applications that read data from Kafka topics.  
  - Consumers can be part of a **consumer group** to distribute load.

- **Consumer Groups**  
  - A collection of consumer applications that work together to consume messages from a topic's partitions.  
  - Each message is consumed by only one consumer within the group to prevent duplicate processing.  

- **Clusters**: Groups of brokers that manage the storage and retrieval of messages.  

- **Zookeepers**: Services that manage and coordinate Kafka clusters.  

- **Replication Mechanism**: Ensures fault tolerance by duplicating data across multiple brokers.

# Storytelling and Presentation in Data Engineering

## Techniques for Effective Group Work

- **Defined roles and responsibilities**: Assign specific tasks like data modeling, pipeline development, and testing.  
- **Regular stand-ups and meetings**: Daily or weekly updates on progress and blockers. Use agile methods to manage workflow.  
- **Clear communication**: Use collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams. Maintain documentation in repositories like GitHub or Confluence.
