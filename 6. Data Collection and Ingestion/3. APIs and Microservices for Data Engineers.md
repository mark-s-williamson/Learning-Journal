# APIs and Microservices

- **Application Programming Interfaces:** Allow two or more applications to communicate by providing a set of procedures and functions.
- **MicroServices** Small, independent blocks within the data engineering ecosystem

### Use Cases of APIs:

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from DBs, external services or APIs
- **Integration**:  Connect different component within an application
- **Communication**: Facilitate interactions between microservices

### Benefits of Microservices
- **Isolation/Modularity**: 
- **Fault Tolerance**:  
- **Language Agnostic**: 
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Elastic Scaling


# Pros and Cons of Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture



| Attribute               | Microservices                           | Monolith                                         |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Scalability               | Easy to Scale to a certain point                           | Complexity increases while scaling up                    |
| Ease of Deployment        | Turnkey deployment                                         | Easy for small applications, harder for bigger ones      |
| Maintenance               | Cloud microservices are easy to maintain                   | Harder for big applications                              |
| Fault Tolerance           | High                                                       | High chance of instability                               |
| Performance               | Added latency overheads of communication between services  | High                                                     |    
| Technology Flexibility    | High                                                       | None                                                     |
| Testability               | Minimal Effort                                             | Complex process                                          |

# API Keys, Service Mesh, API Gateways

## API Keys
Authentication Tokens used to secure access to APIs

- **Implementation**: Generate unique keys per client, Include the key in query parameters. Validate keys on the server.
- **Benefits**: Control access to data endpoints, Monitor usage and enforce rate limits, Enhance security by restricting access to authorised clients.


## Service Mesh
A decentralised communication layer for microservices.

- **Functionality**: Lightweight proxies (sidecars) intercept service to service comms. Provides features like service discovery, load balancing and security.
- **Deployment**: Deployed alongside each microservice. Manages internal app communication. Controls ingress and load balancing.


## API Gateways
A central hub for external interactions with microservices.

- **Role**: Routes requests from clients to backend services. Enforces security and traffic management. Translates communication protocols and aggregates responses.
- **Considerations**: Introduces some latency. Balances security and performance.
