# Automating monitoring processes for data ingestion services

## The importance of monitoring in data engineering

- **Ensure data integrity**: Detect and prevent data loss or corruption.
- **Maintain performance**: Identify bottlenecks and optimise resource utilisation.
- **Enhance reliability**: Quickly detect and respond to system failures or anomalies.
- **Support compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data handling and reporting.

## Industry-standard monitoring tools
### Prometheus
An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit.<br/>
Collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals.

- Multi-dimensional data model with time series data.
- Powerful query language (PromQL) for data analysis.
- Alertmanager for handling alerts.

### Grafana
An open-source platform for data visualisation and analytics.<br/>
Supports various data sources, including Prometheus.

- Customisable dashboards and panels.
- Templating and variables for dynamic dashboards.
- Alerting capabilities integrated with visualisations.

## Kafka Metrics in Prometheus and Grafana
### Broker metrics:

- **Under-replicated partitions:** Indicates potential data loss risk.
- **Offline partitions:** Partitions that are not available.
- **Active controller count:** Should be exactly one in a healthy cluster.

### Producer metrics:

- **Request latency:** Time taken to process requests.
- **Error rates:** Number of failed requests.

### Consumer metrics:

- **Consumer lag:** Difference between the latest offset and the consumer's offset.
- **Consumption rate:** Messages consumed per second.

# Forecasting techniques for data ingestion

## Introduction to time series forecasting
- **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **SARIMAX** (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors)
- **Prophet**
- **Machine Learning Models (e.g., LSTM networks)**

### ARIMA
**Components**:

- **AR (AutoRegressive)**: Regression of the variable on its own lagged values.
- **I (Integrated)**: Differencing of raw observations to make the time series stationary.
- **MA (Moving Average** Modelling the error term as a linear combination of error terms occurring contemporaneously and at various times in the past.

**Use Cases**: short-term forecasting when data is stationary.

### SARIMAX
Like ARIMA but with Seasonaility, Exogenous Variables and Trend components<br/>
**Use Cases**: Effective for data with seasonal effects and external influencing factors.

# Anomaly detection in data streams
## Anomalies
- **System failures**: Hardware malfunctions or software bugs.
- **Security breaches**: Unauthorised access or data tampering.
- **Operational issues**: Configuration errors, resource exhaustion.
- **ata quality problems**: Corrupted or missing data.

## Anomaly Detection Techniques
### Statistical Methods
- **z-Score Analysis**: Measures how many standard deviations from the mean.
- **Seasonal Hubrid ESD (Extreme Studentised Deviate)**: Detects anomalies in seasonal time series data.

### Machine Learning Models
- **Isolation Forest**: An unsupervised learning algorithm that isolates anomalies based on random partitioning.
- **One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Learns the boundary of normal data to detect outliers.

### Time Series Models
- **ARIMAX/SARIMAX**
- **Prophet**: A forecasting tool by Facebook that can model and detect anomalies in time series data.

# Addressing real-world use cases and typical ingestion issues
## Consumer lag and latency
### Symptoms
- Consumers fall behind the latest messages.
- Increased message processing delays.
### Causes
- Insufficient consumer resources.
- Slow processing logic.
- Network congestion.
### Solutions
- Scale consumer instances.
- Optimise processing code.
- Enhance network bandwidth.

## Message Loss
### Symptoms
- Missing data in downstream systems.
- Inconsistent data processing results.
### Causes
- Incorrect producer configurations.
- Insufficient replication.
- Data retention policies.
### Solutions
- Configure appropriate acknowledgments (acks=all).
- Increase replication factor.
- Adjust retention settings.

## Broker Failures
### Symptoms
- Unavailable partitions.
- Errors in producers and consumers.
### Causes
- Hardware failures.
- Configuration errors.
- Resource exhaustion.
### Solutions
- Implement redundancy.
- Use automatic broker recovery.
- Monitor resource utilisation.

## Security Breaches
### Symptoms
- Unauthorised access to data.
- Suspicious activities in logs.
### Causes
- Weak authentication.
- Misconfigured access controls.
- Vulnerabilities in the system.
### Solutions
- Implement robust security measures (SSL, SASL, ACLs).
- Regularly audit security configurations.
- Apply patches and updates promptly.
