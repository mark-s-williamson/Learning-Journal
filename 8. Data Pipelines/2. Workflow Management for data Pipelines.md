# Principles of Workflow Management

## Why workflow management matters
- Dependency Tracking
- Error Handling and Retries
- Logging and Observability
- Modularity and reusability

## Five Principles of Workflow Management
- Define tasks clearly
- Use Dependency-driven execution
- Design for failure
- Centralise logging and Monitoring
- Keep it Modular


# Creating and managing data pipeline workflows

## Common Workflow Patterns
- Linear Chains
- Fan-out/Fan-in
- Conditional Branching
- Sensor-Driven

## What orchestration tools actually do
- Define workflows using code or config (Python/YAML)
- Schedule tasks to run at times or after events
- Manage dependencies
- Retry on Failure or Send Alerts
- Provide visual dashboards for monitoring task status, logs and history
- Track state

### Apache Airflow
- Workflows are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Python
- Built in UI for tracking and retrying tasks
- Good for ETL/Batch pipelines

### Prefect
- Simpler syntax than Airflow
- Offers cloud based Orchestration
- Better suited to dynamic workflows and real-time triggers

# Techniques for optimising data workflows
**Three key techniques for workflow optimisation**
- Parallelism and Concurrency
- Caching intermediate results
- Scaling Resources Strategically

# Automation strategies for repetitive tasks

## Three categories of tasks suitable for Automation
- Routine Scheduling
- Event-driven triggers
- Re-usable workflow template (Don't Repeat Yourself)


# Monitoring and maintaining workflow efficiency
- Task Success/Failure Rates
- Execution times
- Resource Usage
- Queue Backlogs

## Maintaining Workflow Health proactively
- Review logs regularly
- Test changes in isolation
- Clean up and optimise
- Set alerts and thresholds
