# Limitations of traditional ETL
- **Latency and Delayed Insights** - Esp with regards to fraud detection etc
- **Rigid Architecture**
- **Centralised Transformation Bottlenecks**
- **Poor Support for Unstructured and Semi-Structured Data**
- **Difficult to Scale and Monitor**

# Modern Data Integration

## Data Federation
Querying multiple systems without ever copying data.<br/>
Can pull from APIs

## Data Virtualisation
Applying a consistent Schema over disparate systems.

## Data Blending

## ELT
Leverages horizontal scaling to avoid transformation bottlenecks.

# Real-time and Streaming Data Integration

## Streaming Pipeline
- **Data:** e.g Kafka pub
- **Collect:** Kafka
- **Process:** Spark Streaming / Kafka API
- **Store:** MAPR-DB/JSON
- **Analyse:** SparkSQL, Apache Drill, SQL, Open, JSON, API

# Architectural Approaches to Integration

## 1: Point-to-Point Integration
Each system connects directly to each other system.<br/>
Fast, but fragile. Any system going down breaks the whole.<br/>
Gets real complicated, real fast.

## 2: Hub and Spoke or Bus Architecture
Like the datahub (hub and spoke). The centralised processing can be a single point of failure though.

## 3: Distributed or decentralised integration

# Tooling Ecosystem Overview

## Data Extraction and Ingestion
- **Apache NiFi**: Allows Engineers to design flows visually.<br/>
Good for edge ingestion as it supports  APIs, IoT, FTP, Kafka, Message Queueing Telemetry Transport (MQTT).

## Streaming Services
- **Kafka**

## Transformation / processing
- **Talend**: Enterprise-scale batch transformations.
- **Data Build Tool (dbt)**: Cloud-Native, SQL driven.

## Orchestration and Workflow Management
- **Apache Airflow**
- **Prefect**

## Monitoring and Observability
- **Prometheus**
- **Grafana**
- **Great Expectations**
- **OpenLineage**
